This project is inspired by John-Weeks-Dev project on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzuqwqP1wAQ

I took the step further to better structure the projects, fix the overlooked coding issues and DRY the code.

## What I learned

I am not a huge fan of tailwind but it is the first time that I built the app mostly used tailwind. Honestly, still think writing huge block of utility class in HTML is that elegant way. Whenver, you found yourself write same block of tailwind classes, you might still want to extract these out. Create a class and @apply tailwind class there.

## App Setup

```
npm i

npm run dev
```
