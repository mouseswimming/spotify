# Spotify Clone

This project is inspired by [John-Weeks-Dev project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzuqwqP1wAQ)

I took the step further to better structure the projects, fix the overlooked coding issues and DRY the code.

## What I learned

### Tailwind

I am not a huge fan of tailwind but it is the first time that I built the app mostly used tailwind. Honestly, still think writing huge block of utility class in HTML is that elegant way. Whenver, you found yourself write same block of tailwind classes, you might still want to extract these out. Create a class and @apply tailwind class there.

### New CSS selector

CSS has evloved a lot and with some new features. Use new feature like `hover:hover` to do feature dector and provide better UX for different device.
